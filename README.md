# Fatec Projects
Hey there, this repository is where we store some of the projects
We are going to make until the end of the course.
It may vary from simple code to complex algorithms

## Are these projects part of our college studies plan?
More or less, the ideas may come from our classes, but it is not
necessarily an official work in group or something similar.
It is more my initiative and other collegue's as well

## Who can colaborate with it?
Anyone who want to give a nice idea of code

## How to see the projects?
It is simple! Just switch the branch to the project you would like to see :)
